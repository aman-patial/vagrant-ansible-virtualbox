# vagrant-ansible-virtualbox

This repository contains a example virtual machines running various applications. The VMs are created via Vagrant and provisioned via Ansible.

You can `cd` into `vagrant-ansible-virtualbox` directories and run `vagrant up`, and a generic Linux VM will be booted and configured in a few minutes. You just need to install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), and [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
